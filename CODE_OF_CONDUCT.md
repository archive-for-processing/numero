# número Community Statement and Code of Conduct

## número Community Statement

Adapted from the [p5.js](http://p5js.org/community/) and [ml5.js](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-library/blob/development/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) community statements.

número is a community interested in exploring the creation of art and design with technology. 

We are a community of, and in solidarity with, people from every gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, and background. We acknowledge that not everyone has the time, financial means, or capacity to actively participate, but we recognize and encourage involvement of all kinds. We facilitate and foster access and empowerment. We are all learners.

We like these hashtags: #noCodeSnobs (because we value community over efficiency), #newKidLove (because we all started somewhere), #unassumeCore (because we don't assume knowledge), and #BlackLivesMatter (because of course).


**In practice:**


-  We are not code snobs. We do not assume knowledge or imply there are things that somebody should know.
-  We insist on actively engaging with requests for feedback regardless of their complexity.
-  We welcome newcomers and prioritize the education of others. We strive to approach all tasks with the enthusiasm of a newcomer. Because we believe that newcomers are just as valuable in this effort as experts.
-  We consistently make the effort to actively recognize and validate multiple types of contributions.
-  We are always willing to offer help or guidance.


**In times of conflict:**

-  We listen.
-  We clearly communicate while acknowledging other's feelings.
-  We admit when we're wrong, apologize, and accept responsibility for our actions.
-  We are continuously seeking to improve ourselves and our community.
-  We keep our community respectful and open.
-  We make everyone feel heard.
-  We are mindful and kind in our interactions.


**In the future:**

-  The future is now.

### Contribute

Our community is always looking for enthusiasts to help in all different ways. 

-  **Develop**. [GitHub](https://github.com/nickmcintyre/numero) is the main place where code is collected, issues are documented, and discussions about code are had. Check out the [contributing documentation to get started](https://github.com/nickmcintyre/numero/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) with developing the library.
-  **Document**. Everyone loves documentation. Help is needed porting examples, adding documentation, and creating tutorials.
-  **Teach**. Teach a workshop, a class, a friend, a collaborator! Consider sharing what you're up to on the [Processing Foundation Discourse](https://discourse.processing.org).
-  **Create**. número is looking for designers, artists, coders, programmers to bring your creative and amazing work to show and inspire other people. Submit your work to nick@mcintyre.io.
-  **Donate**. número is free and open source and made by volunteers. While número is not currently accepting donations, you can help support the development of número through a donation to other adjacent open source projects and endeavors such as the [Processing Foundation](https://processingfoundation.org/support).

## Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when
an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.
Examples of representing a project or community include using an official
project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting
as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of
a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at nick@mcintyre.io. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
