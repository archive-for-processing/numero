> A friendly and intuitive math library for p5.js

This project aims to bring the mathematical chops of [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) to the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) ecosystem. A few guiding principles are:

- Focus on beginners.
- Complement core p5.js math functions and play nicely with p5.Vector.
- Make the API familiar (e.g., `createTensor()`).
- Let [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/) handle machine learning.
- Encourage all kinds of contributions.

The initial plan is to develop the library in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) using [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/) as a linear algebra engine.

## Why though?
Excellent libraries like [math.js](https://mathjs.org/) and [p5.dimensions](https://github.com/Smilebags/p5.dimensions.js) already exist. The idea is to study the masters while creating something new: a production-grade library for numeric and symbolic computation that beginners can grow into over time.

Also, math + code = awesome :)
